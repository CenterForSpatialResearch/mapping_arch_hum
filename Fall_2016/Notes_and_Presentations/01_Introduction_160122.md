### 5. Tour of qGIS and types of data
* Tour of qGIS
* Types of data:
  * Definition of a Shapefile:
    * .shp = the main file that stores feature geometry*
    * .shx = stores the index of the feature geometry*
    * .dbf = stores the attribute info. of features*
    * .sbn & .sbx = store the spatial index of features
    * .prj = stores the coordinate system information
    * .xml = stores metadata info
  * Point, line and polygon
  * Raster data
  * View metadata
