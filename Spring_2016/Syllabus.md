# Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities
* Columbia University | GSAPP and A&S | ARCHA6805 | Spring 2016
* Fridays 9-11am | Studio @ Butler
* Office hours: Mondays 10am - 12pm (previous email required)
* Professor: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga (jfs2118)
* Teaching Assistant: Emily Furhman (ef2512)

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to mapping theory and geographic information systems tools. Through the use of open-source GIS software ([qGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)) and open data ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)) students will learn how to critically use mapping tools and geographic data for spatial analysis and representation. In this course, students will work through a series of web tutorials and hands-on in-class exercises to gain a better understanding of how these tools and data can be leveraged to analyze, represent and study past or present urban phenomena. In addition to using existing data, students will also be able to create or bring their own sets of data and questions from other courses and will be able to work with these in our class.

## General Topics
* Basic mapping concepts and techniques
* Data types
* Census data
* Metadata
* Data creation
* Geocoding
* Georeferencing
* Vector and raster data
* Webmapping and crowdsourced data

## Evaluation and Grading
* 5% Attendance
* 10% Class participation and discussion
* 30% Individual assignments
* 15% Final project proposal and midterm presentation
* 40% Final project and final presentation and report

## Resources and Materials
Course files, tutorials and presentations will be located on Courseworks, on the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/) website and on this repository. In addition, students should also contact the Digital Social Science Center (DSSC) located in Lehman Library (SIPA) for extra information and data.

The readings for the class will be duly uploaded to Courseworks. Similarly, students will be required to submit their assignments by uploading them to Courseworks. Finally, the class will also rely heavily on submissions
to the blog. Students will be required to upload some of their own work as well as inspirational material, encouraging and developing a critical stance and visual skills.

**These two next things need to be updated**
