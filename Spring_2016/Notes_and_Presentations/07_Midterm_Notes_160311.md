## Midterm - Notes

### 1. Under Water (Anna Kueck and Erik Lin-Greenberg)
* Overall, the idea of the project is very interesting. It just needs more definition and a better and more cohesive graphical presentation.
* Define exactly what a 'vulnerable population' is. Is it defined by age, income, educational level, health, all of them? Create maps showing concentrations of 'vulnerable population'.
* What is 'survivable infrastructure'?
* Your maps need to be better formatted:
  * More cohesive color palette
  * The projection for the tri-state area is not the common one
  * You need to annotate them much better (use labels and call-outs)

### 2. Event-led Displacement in Cities: A Mapping Study on Rio de Janeiro (Avantika Goswami, Nadia Soerjanto, Zach Zill, Eunseon Hur)
* Overall, this is a very interesting project. You should think about the role that London plays in your project: is it just an introduction to displacement due to events or are you going to make your project about the comparison between London and Rio?
* Your graphics are good, but there's potential for more maps and graphs instead of bullet points and text. Some more detailed comments are here:
  * Replace a lot of your bullet points for maps and graphs
  * Your timeline could use a legend and better use of color
  * Your maps could use more labels and call-outs
  * Look for OpenStreet Map data in [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/) and in [Mapzen Metro-Extracts](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/). You should be able to find more base data for Rio (and for other cities) there.
  * Marking eviction locations as points is not the most useful notation. Ideally, if you could, it would be great to see the extent of the eviction, maybe by zooming into the map at those locations and showing the extent of the eviction. I know it's very difficult to get data for this, but it's worth a try.
  * I think zooming into the Vila Autodromo is a very good idea. Try to get better resolution images from Google Earth **Pro** which should be available on some library computers (in the SIPA library for example).
  * The Vila Autodromo timeline could also use more labels.

### 3. Mapping Patterns of Investment and Disinvestment in Manhattan (George Bajalia, Pedro Ce√±al Murga, Tess Domb Sadof, Michael Nickerson)
* Overall your project feels very disjointed. There are too many competing ideas, datasets and questions. You really need to focus your project and make it about one thing. There are very good ideas though. Examining what is **not** covered or visualized through 311 data is very interesting. Looking at patterns of investment vs. disinvestment is also very interesting. However, those are two different projects.
* Here are some other comments:
  * Your maps look good. However, they could use some more labels and call-outs, highlighting specific moments or outliers in the data.
  * The business classification seems very arbitrary and incomplete. There must be better ways of classifying this data and showing specific concentrations. If we were in a more advanced class you could do some type of cluster analysis to see if certain kinds of businesses are indeed statistically clustered or if it's just random location. You should look into this.
  * Extracting policing data from 311 complaints seems like a stretch to me. Remember, 311 data only speaks about the people who complain, not about the realities on the ground or police behavior.
  * Again, extracting homeless data from 311 is a stretch. There should be better data sources for this kind of information.

### 4. Transformation of Neighborhoods (Yuri Kim, Yi-Yen Wang, Jason B Zhao, Tola Onyangi)
* This project is very interesting but it needs to find a better way to compare the two neighborhoods, both in graphical terms as in content. Really think about what it means to compare two places, it is not just showing them side by side. You need to underline and highlight differences. Your maps and graphs should bring these differences out, not just display raw information.
* Overall, you should choose your data, your maps and your graphs much more carefully. You need to curate your information (without distorting it) to make it show the fundamental differences that you've found.
* Also your comparisons are based on time so you should figure out a way of showing change over time. This might not necessarily be through maps. Start simple, with straight line graphs and then try to make your graphs and maps more sophisticated to include this information.
* Some other comments:
  * Graphical examples are mainly for your use. You don't need to include them in your presentation unless you are using them to make an important point.
  * You should have a consistent graphical style. Some of your maps have a satellite image as base and other don't. Make them more consistent.
  * You need to better define the boundaries of Chelsea. In some of your maps the neighborhood goes up to 34th street and in others it gets cut off. Be more consistent here too.
  * The High-Line is completely absent from your presentation. It's is a crucial element in the change of this neighborhood. It should not be missing.

### 5. Mapping the Baburnama (Manpreet Kaur, Phillip Robert Polefrone, Yousef Khalifa Al-Ghufli)
* This project is very interesting. It has two very compelling directions: one, the methods and two, what to do with the information that is produced, how to display it and how to make it useful and interesting. I think you should really tackle both aspects: really document your process and talk about how to do this kind of analysis, what the advantages and disadvantages are, what the difficulties and limits are, and also really create something that is visually compelling and useful for the audience; convey your information in a manner that it enriches the reading of the text and its analysis.
* Some other comments:
  * You need to give a better introduction to the text. What it is about and why it is important.
  * Try not to use screen-shots. All your maps should be complete.
  * Maybe it would be good to create a diagram of your process, showing the different steps, programs, languages, etc.
  * For the final, think about your graphical style. Do you want to continue using the historical maps as a base or do you want to use something different. If you do want to use the historical maps, try to make them more your own, not just place them underneath your new data.
  * Use legends, titles and labels in a more clear and precise way.
